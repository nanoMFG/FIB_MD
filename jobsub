# Sample Batch Queue Script
#
# Option: -q, which batch queue to run in
#PBS -q cse
#
# Option: -l nodes, how many nodes to run on, note
# that the ":ppn=12" directive is important. It
# must always be used.
#PBS -l nodes=8:ppn=12
#
# Option: -l ncpus, how many processors to run on
# is not supported on Turing, request nodes only
##PBS -l ncpus=12
#
# Option: -l pmem, memory requested, 2gb, 2mb, etc##PBS -l pmem=2gb
#
#
# Option: -l walltime, request this amount of wall
# clock time for your job.  Format is hh:mm:ss
# The default is 1 hour, the limit is 3 days.
# The following requests 30 minutes:
#PBS -l walltime=24:00:00
#
#
# Option: -j oe, combines stdout and stderr into a 
# single file.
#PBS -j oe
#
# Option: -o, specifies the name of the output file
# which will be found in ${PBS_O_WORKDIR} after your
# job completes.
#PBS -o error.out
#
# Option: -N, names the job
#PBS -N si_bub
#
# Change directories to the directory where the qsub 
# command was issued.
cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
#
#
# For now, we need to make sure to re-load the MPI module
# This requirement will probably go away shortly.
module load mvapich2/1.6-gcc+ifort
#
#
# Now run the application:
mpiexec ./mdrun2 >> log.out
